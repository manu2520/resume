      <li>Education Inequality - 

        Education inequality occurs when some students have fewer opportunities to succeed due to factors like income, race, or where they live. Students in poorer or underserved areas often attend schools with fewer resources, less experienced teachers, and limited support. This leads to long-term disadvantages, such as fewer job opportunities and social mobility. Addressing education inequality requires ensuring all students have equal access to quality education and resources</li>
